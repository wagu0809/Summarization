# Summarization
Summarization model using Bert

For now, not only BERT can be used to obtain SOTA results, also the lib pytorch_transformers provides some other new models

This is frame which can be easily changed to fit new models, data pre-processing can also be modified to fit to the model

in ./data, there are pre-processed CNN/daily mail data

in ./model, checkpoints saved during training
